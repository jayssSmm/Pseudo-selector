# CSS Pseudo Selector Practice

This mini project is part of my **Responsive Web Design** certification journey on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

### ðŸ“Œ What I Practiced:
- `:hover` for interactive buttons and elements
- `:nth-child()` and `:nth-of-type()` for styling lists
- `:first-child` / `:last-child` for targeting specific elements
- Clean layout using semantic HTML + CSS

---

### ðŸš€ Why It Matters:
Pseudo selectors allow you to apply CSS styles **dynamically** based on the structure or interaction with elements â€” no JavaScript needed.
